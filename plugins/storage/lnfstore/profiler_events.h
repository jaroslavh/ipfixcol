/**
 * \brief Process a data record

 * profiles and channels.
 *
 * When this event manager recognizes that profiling configuration has been
 * changed, it'll try to map old profiles/channels to new profiles/channels.
 *  - When mapping of a profile/channel is successful and no parameters has been
 *    changed no special callback is called.
 *  - When the mapping is successful but parameters of the profile/channel has
 *    been changed ::pevents_update_cb callback is called.
 *  - When mapping is not successful and a profile/channel doesn't exist anymore
 *    ::pevents_delete_cb callback is called.
 *  - When mapping is not successful and a profile/channel is new,
 *    ::pevents_create_cb callback is called.
 *
 * \note
 *   The mapping of channels/profiles guarantee following order of callbacks:
 *   First, delete callbacks are called, followed by update callbacks and
 *   finally create callbacks are called. The reason of this order is to
 *   prevent collision of shared resources (files, etc.).
 *
 * \note
 *   If a channel/profile is mentioned multiple times in the \p channels
 *   variable. The "data" channel/profile callback is called only once.
 *
 * \note
 *   The manager can map old profiles/channels to new ones only when the names
 *   of profiles/names are still same.
 *
 * \param[in,out] mgr         Event manager
 * \param[in]     channels    Pointer to null-terminated array of channels
 *   where the \p data belongs.
 * \param[in]     data        Pointer to data record
